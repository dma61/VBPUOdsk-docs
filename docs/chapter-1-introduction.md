# Chapter 1: Introduction

            This chapter discusses the context, purpose, and target audience of this manual. We also present the setup of the manual.

            ## 1.1 Context
            **Final Report**

            With the introduction of the Future Pensions Act (Wtp), a tighter alignment between fund assets and personal pension assets is necessary, increasing the frequency of information exchange. The final report "Research Results: Standard for data exchange between pension administration & asset management parties" details the required functional data and information flows for both the solidarity and flexible premium schemes.

            **Follow-up & Governance**

            SIVI is translating the final report into a data standard based on AFD 2.0, with 14 messages exchanged via REST-API. The standard is owned by the Pension Federation and managed by SIVI, with an advisory board supporting its development.

            ## 1.2 Purpose
            This manual provides analysts and developers with a guide to implement the standard and gives stakeholders insight into its management.

            ## 1.3 Target Audience
            This manual is for consultants, analysts, and developers involved in implementing the data exchange standard.

            ## 1.4 Setup & 1.5 Links
            The manual uses a dual naming convention (`technicalName` and `Functional Name`) for clarity during transition. The full translation table is in the appendices. Links are colored blue.
