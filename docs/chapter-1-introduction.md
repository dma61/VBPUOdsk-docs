# Chapter 1: Introduction
In this introduction, we discuss the context, purpose, and target audience of this manual. We also present (in considerable detail) the setup of the manual.

## 1.1 Context
### Final Report
In early September 2023, the final report "Research Results: Standard for data exchange between pension administration & asset management parties" was published.
With the introduction/implementation of the Future Pensions Act (Wtp), a tighter alignment between fund assets and the collective administration of personal pension assets is necessary.

### Follow-up & Governance
SIVI is translating the final report into a data standard based on AFD 2.0. The standard is owned by the Pension Federation and managed by SIVI.

## 1.2 Purpose
This manual provides analysts and developers with a guide to implement the standard and gives stakeholders insight into its management.

## 1.3 Target Audience
This manual is for consultants, analysts, and developers involved in implementing the data exchange standard.

## 1.4 Setup
This section outlines the structure of the manual.
